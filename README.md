Installation

CocoaPods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. 
To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:
pod 'Alamofire'

Carthage
Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.
github "Alamofire/Alamofire"

Swift Package Manager
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.
Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

    .package(url: "https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "5.6.1"))
]
